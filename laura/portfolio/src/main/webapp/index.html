      <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
        <p> Hello, there! I am Laura, I'm 19yo and I live in Bucharest, Romania.
          Since 2019, I study Computer Science at University College, Oxford (the oldest college, founded in 13th century).</p>

        <p> This is my portofolio for the 2020 STEP internship at Google.</p>
        <p> In my spare time I enjoy sports (fencing and skiing in particular), going out with friends, cooking new recipes and traveling.</p>
